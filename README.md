# JavaScript Playground

Hey there! 👋  
This repo is where I keep all my random JavaScript practice stuff.  
It’s not a polished project or a big framework — just me learning, experimenting, and trying out little tasks to get better at JS.  

---

## 🧑‍💻 What you’ll find here
- Tiny JS challenges I solved  
- Random snippets I wrote just to “see what happens”  
- Mini side-experiments that may or may not make sense 😅  

---

##  🚀  Why this repo exists

I wanted a place where I can practice without overthinking. Think of it as my coding gym — some workouts are messy, some are neat, but all of them make me stronger with JavaScript.

---

## 🙌 How you can use it
- Browse around like you’re peeking into someone’s notebook  
- Copy stuff, run it, break it, fix it  
- If you see a smarter/cleaner way to write something, I’d actually love to hear it!

## 📝 Final note
This repo is just me practicing — nothing too serious.  
Some code will be clean, some will be messy, and some might not even work the first time.  
That’s kind of the point though: I’m here to learn and get better step by step.
